:wave: My name is Alexander Werner and I am a software engineer at TDS Telecom specializing in API design and backend engineering. I am also a student at New York University. The repositories on my Github mainly focus on side projects that let me learn about technologies that I might not learn at work or in school. I am passionate about the affect that ease of use has on engagement, efficient API design and embedded programming. I am the creator of the communal playlist maker [ThePlaylistMaker.com](https://theplaylistmaker.com/), and believe that I have implemented most of my knowledge (other than embedded programming) into this website.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on rewriting my playlist maker in React - I feel that React lends itself very well to this project because it does a lot of background API calls that would be much cleaner in React. I also hope to take my [RPi Remote Control](https://github.com/alexwerner9/IR-remote-control) and embed it onto a chip and package it for actual use. I hope to get that out later this year, so keep an eye out!
