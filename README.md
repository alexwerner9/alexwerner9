My name is Alexander Werner and I am a software engineer at TDS Telecom specializing in API design and backend engineering as well as a student at New York University. The repositories on my Github mainly focus on side projects that let me learn about technologies that I might not learn at work or in school. I am passionate about the affect that ease of use has on engagement, efficient API design and embedded programming. I am the creator of the communal playlist maker [ThePlaylistMaker.com](https://theplaylistmaker.com/), and believe that I have implemented most of my knowledge (other than embedded programming) into this website.
