:wave: My name is Alexander Werner and I am a software engineer at TDS Telecom specializing in full stack engineering and API design. The repositories on my Github mainly focus on side projects that let me learn about technologies that I might not learn at work, such as embedded programming and passion projects. I am the creator of the communal playlist maker [ThePlaylistMaker.com](https://beta.theplaylistmaker.com/).
